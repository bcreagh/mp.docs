# Mega Project

I started this project at the beginning of 2019. I guess you could say it was a New Year’s resolution. I wanted to build up my Github profile by writing more code, and on a more regular basis. I had tried to make that commitment before, but it never lasted long. I faced the same problem over and over. I would start a project, work on it for a while, and then get distracted by some other new project that I wanted to work on. The result was that I had lots of unfinished, unrelated projects. Lots of repos with not much in them. This was disheartening. When anyone asked me to show them what I was working on, I had nothing to show them. This was especially true if I was asked by someone who was non-technical (like friends, family or even a recruiter). If all you can show them is raw code, they’ll lose interest very quickly.

So I thought to myself, how can I fix this? How do I make sure that I can always show people what I’m working on, regardless of how technical or non-technical the person is? Enter Mega Project! (Apologies for the uncreative name)

As the name suggests, Mega Project is a big project. One big project to connect all my little projects together. To put it very simply, it’s a website. An easy-to-use website which showcases the functionality of all my little projects. Even if you are non-technical, you can use this website to see the projects that I am working on. You can read about how the project works and interact with it. 

But there’s more to it than just a simple website. 

The reason that it is valuable to me as a software engineer is because it saves me a lot of effort. Instead of having to create a new frontend for every project that I work on, I just have one frontend that knows how to use all my backend projects. Whether I’m working on data structures and algorithms, machine learning, system programming or writing my own programming language, the Mega Project frontend knows how to work with them. Any time I find a new shiny technology and decide to start a new project, I can simply hook it up to the Mega Project frontend. With minimal effort, I can now always show people what I’m working on.

# How does it work?

The Mega Project is made up of one web frontend and many backend services. The frontend is designed to work with backend services that follow a standard REST interface. All of the backend services adhere to that interface. Therefore, the frontend is able to work with all of them. Any time I want to start working on a new project, I simply make sure that it is exposed using the standard interface. If it follows the standard interface, all I have to do is register the new project with the frontend.

# Benefits of Mega Project

Mega Project provides many benefits to me as a software engineer:

* I can show people the projects that I am working on
* I don’t have to create a new frontend for every new project that I start
* Mega Project is a system of many projects, it allows me to demonstrate my ability to design a system with many components
* It provides me with a way of practicing and demonstrating my infrastructue skills
* It is an excellent way for me to compare to pros and cons of different programming languages, as each project must adhere to the same interface
* Gives me an incentive to define and follow a high-quality, repeatable development process to use across all of the MP projects
    * Linting
    * Testing
    * Continuous Integration
    * Deployment
    * Etc.
